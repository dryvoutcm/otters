<h1>Otters are Awesome</h1>

<p>Charismatic otters are the largest members of the weasel family. Unlike other weasels, otters are semi-aquatic. 
    Their sleek bodies range in size from 2 to 5.9 feet. Thirteen otter species slide down riverbanks, juggle rocks, 
    and float on their backs in watersheds on five continents. The only places without endemic otters are Australia and Antarctica.</p>


<p>Sea otters, particularly mothers and pups, sometimes hold hands while floating on their backs. Hand-holding keeps the otters from drifting away from each other and 
    their food source while they sleep. They also sleep wrapped in long strands of kelp like a blanket. The kelp acts like an anchor and prevents them from floating
     out to the open ocean.</p>

<p>Sea otters don't just have the densest fur of all otters â€” they have the densest fur of all animals. Otters have as many as 2.6 million hairs per square inch. That thick coat is needed 
    because otters are the only marine mammal without a blubber layer for insulation. To improve the insulating qualities, otters spend five hours grooming their hair each day.</p>
